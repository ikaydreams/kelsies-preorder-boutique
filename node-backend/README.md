# Node.js Backend Project

This is a Node.js backend project that complements an existing React + TypeScript application. It is built using Express and follows a modular structure.

## Project Structure

```
node-backend
├── src
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── controllers       # Contains controller files
│   │   └── index.js      # Index controller for handling requests
│   ├── routes            # Contains route definitions
│   │   └── index.js      # Route definitions for the application
│   └── models            # Contains model definitions
│       └── index.js      # User model for database interactions
├── package.json          # NPM configuration file
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd node-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. The root route is handled by the `IndexController`, which responds with a welcome message.
